              When I coded my first “Hello World” using Notepad at the start of
              the millenium, it felt eye-opening, but did not have substantial
              consequences, other than a number of gif-rich personal pages and
              templates for blog.pl.

              I renewed my study of code in 2021, and my focus is web
              development with Javascript. I still have a certain affinity for
              retro-style design, but I refrain from using neon text effects.<br /><span

              Self-study does nothing to make one feel like an expert, but after

              checking what makes it work. It seems that every little topic I

        <h3 class="reveal">Flipping Flashcards</h3>
        <p class="reveal languages">javascript &middot; html &middot; css</p>

        <div class="about-project">
          <p class="reveal">
            Flipping Flashcards was inspired by a discussion online where the consensus was that flashcards were a brilliant tool for learning anything under the sun and acing exams. This being the 21st century, I was not about to make paper flashcards, but  a card flipping animation has been essential to my vision from the start. At no point did I try any existing flashcard apps; it was no more than a millisecond between “I’d like to try an app like this” to “I think I can make something like this”. 
          </p>

          <a class="modal-toggle">
            <div class="contain-thumb right-slide">
              <div class="thumb flashcards-1"></div>
            </div>
          </a>

          <a class="modal-toggle">
            <div class="contain-thumb right-slide">
              <div class="thumb flashcards-2"></div>
            </div>
          </a>

          <p class="reveal">
            <b class="ordinal">01.</b><br />
            The main features I envisioned for this project were:<br>
            – the card should seem to physically flip<br>
            – the user should be able to upload their own content<br>
            – the user should be able to influence which questions get shown more often<br>
            All of these generated issues that needed solving.
          </p>

          <p class="reveal">
            <b class="ordinal">02.</b><br>
            Coding the interface was the most fun part. For the first iteration, I went a bit crazy with a retro neon design.<br><br>

            I chose <a href="https://nnattawat.github.io/flip/">jQuery Flip</a> as the mechanism to handle card movement. However, it required additional work to make the design accessible. (I ended up binding the up arrow to the flip() function, and for screen readers I added an invisible focusable button that does the same). The rating buttons in this version were positioned outside of the actual flashcard.<br><br>

            A crucial part of the project was allowing the user to indicate how well they knew the answer and translating that to how often a particular card gets shown. Each card object gets assigned a rating of 6 when created, and pressing one of the three rating buttons removes 2, 1, or none of them. The ratings indicate how many times the card gets copied into the temporary array out of which the next random card is drawn. This function runs every time a new card is needed so the array gets refreshed when ratings change.  This system is easy to customise - changing difficulty is as easy as assigning a different rating when the card objects get created (I included that as an option in the settings.)

            There are three sets of cards hard-coded into the .js file, but customising the content was ultimately a necessity. I needed a human-readable format that could also be easily split into strings for use with the factory function. Researching different methods of importing external data into Javascript was a process of trial and error. The original idea was to use either local Excel files or Google Sheets. As interesting as it was to learn to access Google Sheets remotely through Node.js, I wasn't happy with how complex the process of parsing the result was. Fixation on spreadsheets led me to learn how to use the Google Sheets API, followed by <a href="https://github.com/bpk68/g-sheets-api#readme">Google Sheets Reader</a>, veering to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx">SheetsJS</a> for a stab at local spreadsheets, before I finally settled on importing .csv as a string as the simplest, most elegant solution.
          </p>

          <p class="reveal">
            <b class="ordinal">06.</b><br />
            The single most important decision for this project was bringing in a test user. His feedback, combined with <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Jakob Nielsen's article on design heuristics</a>, led me to implement the following changes from v1.0 to 2.0:<br>
            - add a welcome page with a prominent call to action<br>
            - automatically prompt to choose a study subject on load<br>
            - more muted default colour palette, with the option to choose neon colours from settings<br>
            - integrate the rating stars into the back of the flashcard<br>
            - include visible information about the current set, the user’s progress, and current ratings<br>
            - introduce keyboard shortcuts<br>
            - remove detailed user instructions, opting instead to make the interface self-explanatory            
          </p>

          <a class="modal-toggle">
            <div class="contain-thumb right-slide">
              <div class="thumb flashcards-5"></div>
            </div>
          </a>

          <a class="modal-toggle">
            <div class="contain-thumb right-slide">
              <div class="thumb flashcards-6"></div>
            </div>
          </a>

          <p class="reveal">
            <b class="ordinal">07.</b><br>
            I am still working on this project. I have concluded that there is not one best format for importing user questions. CSV is a simple, convenient, readable format, but its lack of text formatting features makes it only suitable for simple questions and one-sentence answers. The solution will be to add yet another accepted file format.<br><br>

            With accessibility in mind, I made sure there were keyboard shortcuts for rating as well as flipping the card without clicking.<br><br>

            Because this project changed so much during development, version control was essential; I took advantage of the option to work on different branches without feeling like I needed to give up one approach to try another. However, for the next project I will make sure to follow a design plan in order to stay on track and avoid doing everything at once.<br><br>

            Additionally, I will involve user feedback at a much earlier stage. It was essential in order to flesh out Flipping Flashcards 2.0, but those choices could have been made much sooner.<br><br>

            Finally, in an ironic twist, I discovered that studying with flashcards is not my thing after all, and I’ve gone back to trusted mind-maps and lists.
