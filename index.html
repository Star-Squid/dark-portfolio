            I'm a junior front-end developer, and began teaching myself to code in

            made for my blog.pl in 2000-2003)/ (the few dozen of personal pages

            about the popularity/comeback of retro/old-style designs) everything
            that I learn inspires me to start a project. Not all ideas can be

            efforts to get into/learn/ back-end, because it seems to me that this
            is where "serious" coding happens, but whenever I see a well-designed
            website, I will spend hours checking what makes it work.

      <h3 class="reveal">Flipping Flashcards</h3>
      <p class="reveal languages">javascript &middot; html &middot; css</p>

      <div class="about-project">
        <p class="reveal">
          Inspired by an article I read, which recommended flashcards as a great
          way to learn annything/as a brilliant tool to learn/for learning
          anything under the sun singing the praises of flashcards as the best
          solution for learning anything. This being the 21st century, I was not
          about to make paper flashcards, but I did have a vision of a card
          flipping.

          The interface Arguably the most fun part. I decided to go a bit crazy
          with retro cyberpunk style and loved it. I chose jQuery flip as a
          mechanism for the most importannt part.

At no point did I check any existing flashcard apps. It took no more than a millisecond to go from “I’d like to try an app like this” to “I think I can make something like this”.

The main features I envisioned for this project were :
The card should seem to physically flip
The user should be able to upload their own content

Both of them generate issues. The jQuery Flip animation makes the content inaccessible to screen readers, which means it should be replaced with a more rigid solution, where the flipping effect would be only decorative.

In order to learn how to make uploading content possible, I went through a process of learning and rejecting different solutions. Initially I thought using a spreadsheet would be the best solution, which led me to learn how to use the Google Sheets API, followed by Google Sheets Reader https://github.com/bpk68/g-sheets-api#readme, veering to SheetsJS https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx to try local spreadsheets, before finally settling for csv as the simplest, most elegant solution.

        </p>

        <p class="reveal">
          <b class="ordinal">02.</b><br />
          Source for questions and answers The first phase was researching
          different methods of extracting data from spreadsheets into Javascript.
          It seemed nnatural to use either local Excel files or google Sheets for
          this purpose. I tesed both and in the process learnt to update Google
          Sheets remotely through node, but I wasn't happy whith how difficult to
          parse the result was. What is more, I realized that spreadsheets are
          neither a natural/convenient not easiest to use solution. In the end, I
          decided to hard-code the content into index.js for now. I wanted to use
          a human-readable format for any new card sets, but one that is simple to
          turn into JavaScript objects for use with the code. &middot; action

          Individual flashcard ratings A crucial part of the project was allowinng
          for a way for the user to indicate if they want to see the same card
          again. I decided on rating buttonns Each card is assigned a rating of 6
          when created, and a series of array actions update it when a hgbjk
          function is triggered at the press of a rating button It wouldn't be
          hard to change the behaviour of the buttons through minor changes in the
          code. The V button could take a card out of circulationn completely, or
          the total nnumber of rating points assigned to each card could be
          lowered to shorten the learning session, or increased so that even cards
          rated V by the user will be shown 4 or more times

          How the code works. (To see it in action on the website, download this example .csv file  xor use one of the three encoded flashcard sets)
In a scenario where the user uploads their own content, first we use ... To parse the input.
It gets split into questions and answers using ..., Then loaded into the factory function x, which turns them into flashcards objects and assigns each a start rating of 6.

Next, x creates an array of all the objects, copying each object into it as many times as its current rating shows. This function will run every time a new card is needed so the array gets refreshed when ratings change. The array then gets randomized.

Nextcard shows the first question of the array in the content of the flashcard. Clicking the card reveals the answer and three clickable stars which allow the user to indicate how well they knew the answer. Clicking the left star (.bad) runs nextcard without changing the currentCard's rating in currentArray, while .medium removes rating 1 point, and .good removes 2.

If the user rates their answer as .good every time, each question gets shown 3 times. When every card in currentArray reaches a rating of 0, tempArray will be empty when nextCard runs, and a final message gets displayed.

Redesign

I also realized i should've brought in a test user at an earlier stage, possibly even when designing. His feedback, combined with x's article on design heuristics, led me to implement the following changes from v1.0 to 1.1:
- welcome page with a prominent call to action
- automatically open the choices dialog on load
- more muted default colour palette, with the option to choose neon colours afterwards
- integrate the rating stars into the back of the flashcard
- include information for the user about their progress and current card and set rating
- introduce keyboard shortcuts
- remove detailed user instructions in a dialog, opting instead to make the interface self-explanatory

          Responsive design This was one of the projects that looked ok when first
          viewed on mobile, but I decided to abandon the classic landscape
          rectangular shape on smaller screens. The new flashcard shape is 80% of
          the viewport width, but no more than 1:1 aspect ratio

          what I learned I am still working on this project. I'd really like o
          find asolution for importing outside data to use with this interface.
          Because I changed the direction of the project more than once, I learned
          to appreciate git for making it possible to work on different branches
          without feeling like i needed to give up one to try another. One day I
          might even start using flashcards to study./ /Most importantly, I learnt
          that I donn't really like studying with flashcards/studying with
          flashcards is nnnot my thinng

      <h3 class="reveal">Workday Clock</h3>
      <p class="reveal languages">javascript &middot; html &middot; css</p>
      <p class="reveal">
        I've never liked using round face analog clocks. The two hands (why should
        the long hand indicate the short time period and not the other way
        around?), the reversing direction (left to right when on top, but right to
        left on the bottom), my general desire to be unique and insufferable/an
        insufferable contrarian... However, watching X's video ... changed my mind
        to an extent and crystallized an idea: yes to a visual representation of
        the length of each hour and the whole day, yes toa way to easily visualize
        time remaining to an appointment, but only one direction of travel, no
        time change/turns off during off duty hours


Text about clock how it works, how you achieved shapes.
The resulting interface features two separate domes, one representing the 9 working hours between 9 and 18, and the other ones minutes of each hour. In order to achieve the rainbow shape of the clock faces, I overlaid a conical gradient with hours on a circular gradient that forms the main shape, added a semi-opaque conical gradient to indicate the passage of time, and a final small circular  gradient forms/creates the bottom of the arch. The time-updating/showing layer is controlled by the summation updateTime(), which runs once per minute. The interval is easy to adjust, but this project does not need higher precision.(Omitted in the pizza colour scheme/theme for higher realism)  /Illustrate in perspective
The appointment feature adds yet another gradient to the stack. TheFunction x converts hours todegree of dome and shades the area between start and end times on the clock. This solution allows for multiple appointments, although if their times overlap, they merge together. This is fine for my purpose, since the appointment feature is only there to help visualize the time remaining before it starts. Activating the dialog without choosing appointment times clears the layer
A fun little extra feature is the additional graphic/colour themes for the clocks. The colours and backgrounds are encoded ascss variables/ in the css as variables, so switching themes is as easy as swapping different :roots
I learnt about css layout, gradients, variables, using time in JavaScript, dialogs (this one uses jquery dialog, but today i prefer dialog or optimized for focusing modal solution
User feedback was invaluable in improving the appointment feature. I added a clear all button, made both start and end time required fields, and restricted the hours to what is displayed on the clock / clear all should just fully transparent the appointment layer
https://youtu.be/NeopkvAP-ag
No analog clocks in my life and that makes him and me l lose track of time because there is no handy way of visualizing how much time is left until a certain moment or until the full hour// all my life I've been a disliker of analog clocks. Not a hater, my feelings are neutral enough to be comfortable using them and negative enough that i haven't owned one in over a decade/haven't had one in my space. It was a video by Technology Connections (where he compares the minute hand toa prices bar)that made me see the merits of them and crystallized an idea for how to improve them. Key features: shows two halves of an hour as equal,... BUT only shows the necessary hours - no need to be concerned about exact time after 18, until next morning's alarm/knowing the exact time between 18 and next morning's alarm is a source of nothing but stress/anxiety, but crucially, the time will be shown linearly. No silly business of the first 30 min going down and the second going up
The clock represents the hour as a circle, but this one represents it as an arch
Small arch is like a close-up, or a more detailed progress bar. I like that it is optimised perfectly to my needs, but should also be immediately understandable readable legible to someone else without extra explanations
